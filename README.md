Raspberry Pi scripts

Welcome to my Raspberry Pi automated scripts!
A little about myself, I am a full time medic, and inbetween calls, I have been enjoying writing scripts! 
its been a learning curve and im sure there is alot more to learn! 

Hoping to make your life easier, or at least alot quicker installs for some of your favourite Pi app/Servers!

I do all my testing on my own Pi's, they are all Pi4, 4gb and 8gb, and on Pi OS bullseye and later versions as released
scripts may or may not work on older version such as Buster etc. feel free to try and report back :)


The scripts can be downloaded manually and ran with, bash filenamexample.sh within the directory it was DL to
